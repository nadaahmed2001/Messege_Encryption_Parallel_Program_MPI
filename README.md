Assignment 3 in High performance Computing (Parrallel processing), Encrypt a message using Caesar Cipher.

# Assignment Describtion
#### [Using BCast, Scatter and Gather ONLY]

You are required to take a message from a file and encrypt the message using caesar cipher and store the output in a new file.\
The encryption can be represented using modular arithmetic by first transforming the letters into
numbers, according to the scheme, A = 0, B = 1,â€¦, Z = 25.

For example :\
Encryption of a letter x by
a shift n can be described mathematically as:
#### En(x) = (x + n) mod 26
Any other character outside the range from A to Z (or a to z) is transferred to the output file as it is.\
**Input:** filename and key/shift value.\
**Output:** new file that contains the encrypted message.

## ScreenShots of my source code output:

**First case:** a messege length is divisible by number of processes, in myfile.txt I have written a string of 20 characters\
so 20/4 = 5 and 20%4=0 ... then each process will handle 5 charachters

**Second case:** a messege length is not divisible by number of processes, in myfile.txt I have written a string of 20 characters\
but used 3 processes, 20%3=2... so each process will take 6 characters and the last 2 characters are handeled by master at the end
